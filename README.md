# Stock Market Prediction Using LSTM Neural Network

This project is an **end-to-end stock market prediction system** built with **Python, LSTM neural networks**, and deployed as an **interactive Streamlit web application**. It predicts stock prices based on historical data and visualizes trends using moving averages.

---

## **Project Overview**

- Fetches historical stock data from Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)  
- Preprocesses and scales data using `MinMaxScaler`  
- Builds an **LSTM neural network** for predicting stock prices  
- Visualizes stock trends with moving averages (MA50, MA100, MA200)  
- Deploys an **interactive web app** using Streamlit for user input and predictions  
- Saves and loads trained models for future use
